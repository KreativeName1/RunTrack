## Description
This project was created as part of the 'Klimalauf' event, serving as a practical exercise for the 12th-grade project exam.
The goal was to improve the manual evaluation of running data, which was collected via barcode scanners and recorded in an Excel file.
Our class was divided into several groups, each developing its own software.
In this project, we also learned how to collaborate using Git and GitHub.

**The Software is currently only available in german.**
