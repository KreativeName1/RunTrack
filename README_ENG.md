## 📖 About the project
This project was created as part of the event ‘Klimalauf’
as a practical exercise for the project exam in year 12. The aim was to
the manual evaluation of the running data, which was recorded using barcode scanners

Our class was divided into several groups, each of which developed their own software.
In this project, we also learnt how to work with Git and GitHub.

**Round recording:** Scanning of barcodes and automatic saving of results.
* Evaluation:** Detailed analyses in the form of diagrams and tables.
